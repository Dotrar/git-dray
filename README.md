# Dregit (dg) Dre's Git tool

Simple git tool for precisely my purposes.


## Features
- Stage files, hunks, lines
- Stash
- Commit
- Fixup
- Amend
- View a log


Everything else is best done by git itself

# Installing

`uv tool install .`
or
`pipx install .`

add a `-e` to install as editable mode if you want to make changes
